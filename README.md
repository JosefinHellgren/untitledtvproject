SwiftUI project for a TV show tracker.

Hi! 

This project was for my class in SwiftUI at IT-h√∂gskolan. I decided to make a TV show tracker using an API to query data and then save that data to firestore.

It was an interesting solo project that taught me lots about various swiftui structures and JSON data formatting.

Download it and have a look, you will have to create an account with email and password to access the app.
